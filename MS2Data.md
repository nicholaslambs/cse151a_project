# Milestone 2 Data

# Data Exploration
Currently, we understand that our data is not accessible through online resources or already gathered data. 
We plan on gathering this data on our own by running through thousands of simulations. Additionally, we plan on feeding the RL Agent with the data in order for it to learn.

We believe that we're going to have to gather a lot of different types of data. For example, in order for our RL Agent to have strong data for it to learn, it needs to know all of the game states to make educated moves that would put itself in a winning position (i.e. using which cards have already been played to make educated moves or probability that other players have wild cards or probabiltity of which color is most likely to chain, etc.)

The data we collect is going to change significantly as we continue to toy around with our simulation and RL Agent because we're going to continuously learn new things about what is important.
Furthermore, we'll learn types of data might be important for the RL Agent to know so that it can gain a higher chance of winning. 

This puts in a situation where we're currently missing a lot of data. While this might sound alarming, we've already started gathering data that we think might be useful for the RL Agent to know about.
